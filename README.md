## How It Works

The EA Bloom Expert Advisor works by continuously monitoring the market for potential entry points and favorable market conditions. It uses virtual orders to assess potential entry points and the indicator interaction algorithm to identify favorable market conditions.

The Expert Advisor operates in the `OnTick()` and `OnChartEvent()` functions. In the `OnTick()` function, it checks if there are any open orders. If no open orders are found, it calls the `CheckEntryPoints()` function to assess potential entry points. If a potential entry point is found, a market order is placed using the `OrderSend()` function.

In the `OnChartEvent()` function, the Expert Advisor checks if the chart event is a custom indicator interaction. If it is, it calls the `CheckIndicatorInteraction()` function to assess favorable market conditions. If favorable market conditions are identified, a market order is placed using the `OrderSend()` function.

The `CheckEntryPoints()` and `CheckIndicatorInteraction()` functions are placeholders for your custom logic to assess potential entry points and favorable market conditions. You can modify these functions to implement your own trading strategy.

The `OnDeinit()` function is called before the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. It closes any open orders before deinitialization using the `OrderClose()` function.
